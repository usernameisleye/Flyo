### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned some new tips while coding my JavaScript, here are a few.

See below:
```js
const all = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
return all.test(value);

 e.preventDefault(); etc.
```

### Continued development

Much work is needed in writing my JavaScript, going deeper into its major sectors and shortening my code. Also see improvements in my CSS handling e.g. usage of positioning.

### Useful resources
